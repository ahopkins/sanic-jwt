Installation
============

Install from pypi using::

    pip install sanic-jwt

Install from GitHub::

    git clone https://github.com/ahopkins/sanic-jwt.git .

.. note:: This package is still in active development. It is recommended to build from GitHub for the latest version since there probably will not be another release to pypi until the package moves out of **Beta**. This will probably be in early Spring 2018.
