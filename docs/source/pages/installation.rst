Installation
============

Install from pypi using::

    pip install sanic-jwt

Not much else to say. Depending upon whether or not you change the encryption algorithm, you may be prompted to also install `cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography>`_. But, we only do that if you know you will need it.

    pip install cryptography
