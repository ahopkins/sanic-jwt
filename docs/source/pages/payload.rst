:doc:`As discussed<whatisjwt>`, JWTs have a payload that is essentially a key/value store of information.

With Sanic JWT, there are three main uses of the payload:

- passing claims (See :doc:`whatisjwt` for more information)
- passing scope (See :doc:`scoped` for more information)
- passing arbitrary information to the client

+++++++++++++++
Built in Claims
+++++++++++++++

Sanic JWT ships with the capability to add, and later verify, **five** standard claims: ``exp``, ``nbf``, ``iat``, ``iss``, and ``aud``.

-----------------
Expires - ``exp``
-----------------

| **Purpose**: This claim is a timestamp that dictates when the access token will no longer be available. Because JWT access tokens cannot be invalidated after they are issued, they are typically given a short life span.
| **Enabled by default**: Yes.
|

.. warning::

    It is possible to disable token expiration. Do **NOT** do this unless you know what you are doing and why you are doing it.

    .. code-block:: python

        Initialize(app, verify_exp=False)

    Okay, great. You know what you are doing. It is still revommended that you **NOT** do this. Are you sure you know what you are doing?


------------------
Audience - ``aud``
------------------

| **Purpose**: This claim identifies what service the JWT is intended to be used with. Typically it is a URI or other identifier that says the name of the client server that is supposed to be validating the token.
| **Enabled by default**: No.
| **How to use**: Set ``claim_aud`` to a ``str``
| **Example**:
|

.. code-block:: python

    Initialize(app, claim_aud='my_client_domain.com')


-------------------
Issued at - ``iat``
-------------------

| **Purpose**: This claim is a timestamp that provides the creation time of the JWT.
| **Enabled by default**: No.
| **How to use**: Set ``claim_iat`` to ``True``
| **Example**:
|

.. code-block:: python

    Initialize(app, claim_iat=True)


----------------
Issuer - ``iss``
----------------

| **Purpose**: This claim is typically a URI or other identifier to say who created and issued the token.
| **Enabled by default**: No.
| **How to use**: Set ``claim_iss`` to a ``str``
| **Example**:
|

.. code-block:: python

    Initialize(app, claim_iss='my_server_domain.com')


--------------------
Not before - ``NBF``
--------------------

| **Purpose**: This claim is a timestamp that allows the token to be created and issued, but not yet enabled for usage until after a certain time.
| **Enabled by default**: No.
| **How to use**: Set ``claim_nbf`` to ``True``, and ``claim_nbf_delta`` to an offset in seconds
| **Example**:
|

.. code-block:: python

    Initialize(app, claim_nbf=True, claim_nbf_delta=(60 * 3))

------------

+++++++++++++
Custom Claims
+++++++++++++

Sometimes you may find a need to add claims to a JWT beyond what is built into Sanic JWT.

To do so, simply subclass ``Claim`` and register them at :doc:`initialization<initialization>` by providing the custom claim class in a list to ``custom_claims``.

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic_jwt import Claim, Initialize

    MyCustomClaim(Claim):
        key = 'foo'

        def setup(self, payload, user):
            return 'bar'

        def verify(self, value):
            return value == 'bar'

    Initialize(..., custom_claims=[MyCustomClaim])

There are three attributes that a ``Claim`` must have: ``key``, ``setup``, and ``verify``.

| ``key``: The name of the claim and the key that will be inserted into the payload.
| ``setup``: A method to be run at the time the payload is created. It should return the value of the claim.
| ``verify``: A method to be run when a token is being verified. It should return a ``boolean`` whether or not the claim has been met.
|

------------

+++++++++++++++++++
Extra Verifications
+++++++++++++++++++

Besides registering custom claims, sometimes you may find the need to do additional verifications on a payload. For example, perhaps you want to run checks that span more than one claim on the payload.

To accomplish this, you can register a list of methods (that each return a ``boolean``) at :doc:`initialization<initialization>` by providing the list to ``extra_verifications``.

.. code-block:: python

    def check_number_of_claims(payload):
        return len(payload.keys()) == 5

    extra_verifications = [check_number_of_claims]
    Initialize(
        ...,
        extra_verifications=extra_verifications
    )

++++++++++++++++
Payload Handlers
++++++++++++++++

:doc:`As discussed<initialization>`, there are a few handlers on the ``Initialize`` instance that can be used to modify the payload.

-------------
Adding Scopes
-------------

| **Argument**: ``add_scopes_to_payload``
| **Purpose**: If you are using the ``@scoped`` :doc:`decorator<scoped>`, then you will need a way to inject the ``payload`` with the user's scopes. It should return either a single scope, or a list of scopes. :doc:`Read about scopes<scoped>` for more information.
| **Return**: ``str`` or a ``list`` of ``str``
| **Example**:
|

.. code-block:: python

    async def my_scope_extender(user, *args, **kwargs):
        return user.scopes

    Initialize(app, add_scopes_to_payload=my_scope_extender)

.. note::

    The return of the ``authenticate`` method will be injected into this handler as ``user`` for your convenience.

---------------------
Extending the payload
---------------------

| **Argument**: ``extend_payload``
| **Purpose**: To add an arbitrary set of claims or information to the payload.
| **Return**: ``dict``
| **Example**:
|

.. code-block:: python

    def my_foo_bar_payload_extender(payload, *args, **kwargs):
        payload.update({
            'foo': 'bar'
        })

        return payload

    Initialize(app, extend_payload=my_foo_bar_payload_extender)

+++++++++++++
Token signing
+++++++++++++

JWTs need to be digitally signed to allow for cryptographically verifying that an access token was generated by your application.

.. code-block:: python

    secret = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'

    Initialize(
        app,
        secret=mysecret)

There are several hashing algorithms that can be used to accomplish this. Check out the :doc:`configuration` page to see which algorithms are supported, and `read this <https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms.html#digital-signature-algorithms>`_ for more information.

If you decide to use an RSA or an EC algorithm, then you **must** provide Sanic JWT with both a public key and a private key to handle the encoding and decoding of the tokens.

.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path

    public_ec_key = Path('/path') / 'to' / 'my-ec-public-key.pem'
    private_ec_key = Path('/path') / 'to' / 'my-ec-private-key.pem'

    Initialize(
        app,
        public_key=public_ec_key,
        private_key=private_ec_key,
        algorithm='ES256')


+++++++++++++++++
Encrypted Payload
+++++++++++++++++

Sometimes you may want to hide payload content. So it should be useful if you can encrypt this content. Sanic-jwt provides Fernet encryption of the Payload. You must provider the encryption key and (optionally a salt value).

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic import Sanic
    from sanic_jwt import AuthenticationEncrypted, Initialize

    app = Sanic()
    app.config.ENCRYPT_PASSWORD = "ASDFAsdfkjalsdfjlkasdfjlkasdjflksaKSKSKS"
    app.config.ENCRYPT_SALT = "ASDFAsdfkjalsdfjlkasdfjlkasdjflksa"  # This is optional

    Initialize(app, authentication_class=AuthenticationEncrypted)
